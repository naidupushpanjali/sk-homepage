                <p>We give you a unique user name and two passwords one for just Browsing and one solely for transaction purposes. When you place an order we ask you for the transaction password which authenticates your identity from our highly secured database. The system also has a feature which automatically expires your transaction password in 30days . This would mean we force you to change your password every month for ensuring high security for all your transactions. You can also change your password online at any time. In addition, you can use the Log Off button located throughout the site to securely exit your account without closing your browser.</p>

                    Also there is an internal session manager that ensures that even if you are not around your browser for more than 20 minutes it asks for a login once you are back to ensure that no one else can twiddle around in your transactions and throw up a surprise for you (Pun intended!!)
